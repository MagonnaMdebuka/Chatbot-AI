ðŸš€ **AI ChatBot App** ðŸš€

I recently built a chatbot app as a personal project to explore and experiment with **Generative AI**. The app allows users to engage in dynamic conversations with an AI, where their messages are processed and responded to in real-time.

### Key Features:
- **User Interaction**: Users can type and send messages to the AI, which generates thoughtful and contextually relevant responses.
- **Real-Time AI Responses**: The chatbot responds instantly, making the conversation feel interactive and seamless.
- **Typing Indicator**: A typing status is displayed while the AI processes responses, creating a more natural conversation flow.

### Technologies Used:
- **Flutter** for building the app's user interface
- **Google Generative AI API** for the backend AI processing
- **Firebase** for user authentication and app integration

This was a great opportunity for me to dive deeper into **Generative AI** and experiment with how it can be used to build engaging, intelligent applications. Excited to continue exploring AI's potential in shaping the future of user interaction!
